<h1>Hi there! I'm Norbert.</h1>

My journey into web development began with a simple "Hello world" in HTML — and quickly grew into a full-fledged passion for building user-focused digital experiences. With over four years of hands-on experience, I specialise in crafting responsive, modern front-ends using WordPress and Laravel Blade templating.

Originally self-taught through late nights and weekends, I’ve since completed multiple web development courses and worked on a variety of freelance and commercial projects. My current focus is on delivering pixel-perfect, fast, and accessible interfaces, while collaborating closely with back-end teams and clients.
